# IMPORTANT INFO

This simple website fetches data from the Zen Quotes API.
Due to the CORS policy, I could not fetch data.
So, there is a proxy server in the `backend` folder to get around it.
You **must download the necessary node modules to get the proxy server working** 
because the front end fetches the data from said proxy server

# STEPS

1. Clone this repo
2. CD your way into the `backend` folder
3. run the command `npm i` or `npm install` to install the necessary node modules
4. Once finished, run the command `nodemon server.js` to run the proxy server
5. Now you can view the HTML. If you are using VS Code, open with live server
